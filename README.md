A library for creating old-school dungeon crawlers.

### Importing library

You can import the generated bundle to use the whole library generated by this starter:

```javascript
import mudjs from 'mudjs'
```

[comment]: <> (Additionally, you can import the transpiled modules from `dist/lib` in case you have a modular library:)

[comment]: <> (```javascript)

[comment]: <> (import something from 'mylib/dist/lib/something')

[comment]: <> (```)

### NPM Scripts

#### Development

- `npm start`: Run `npm run build` in watch mode

#### Testing

- `npm run test:watch`: Run test suite in [interactive watch mode](http://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/cli.html#watch)
- `npm run test:prod`: Run linting and generate test coverage report
- `npm run lint`: Lints code

#### Building

- `npm run build`: Generate bundles and typings, create docs

#### Committing

- `npm run commit`: Commit using conventional commit style

[comment]: <> (### Excluding peerDependencies)

[comment]: <> (On library development, one might want to set some peer dependencies, and thus remove those from the final bundle. You can see in [Rollup docs]&#40;https://rollupjs.org/#peer-dependencies&#41; how to do that.)

[comment]: <> (Good news: the setup is here for you, you must only include the dependency name in `external` property within `rollup.config.ts`. For example, if you want to exclude `lodash`, just write there `external: ['lodash']`.)

[comment]: <> (### FAQ)

[comment]: <> (#### `Array.prototype.from`, `Promise`, `Map`... is undefined?)

[comment]: <> (TypeScript or Babel only provides down-emits on syntactical features &#40;`class`, `let`, `async/await`...&#41;, but not on functional features &#40;`Array.prototype.find`, `Set`, `Promise`...&#41;, . For that, you need Polyfills, such as [`core-js`]&#40;https://github.com/zloirock/core-js&#41; or [`babel-polyfill`]&#40;https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/&#41; &#40;which extends `core-js`&#41;.)

[comment]: <> (For a library, `core-js` plays very nicely, since you can import just the polyfills you need:)

[comment]: <> (```javascript)

[comment]: <> (import "core-js/fn/array/find")

[comment]: <> (import "core-js/fn/string/includes")

[comment]: <> (import "core-js/fn/promise")

[comment]: <> (```)
